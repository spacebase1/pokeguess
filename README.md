## Overview

- Simple website that outputs random Pokémon from the selected generations
- Pokémon's name is visible when the cursor is over the image
- [Website Link](https://poplio883.github.io/)

## Options

- **Show Number**: Shows the Pokémon's *National Pokédex* number next to its name
- **Always Show Name**: Always shows the Pokémon's name and region (and number, if the previous option is checked)
- **Always Show Region**: Makes the Pokémon's region always visible
- **Toggle Silhouette**: Toggles silhouette only mode

## Notes

- Enabling *Always Show Region* when *Always Show Name* is already enabled makes no difference
- The website is ***not optimized for mobile viewing*** and as such is not recommended to view on a mobile device
